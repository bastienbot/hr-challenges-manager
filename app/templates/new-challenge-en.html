Hello {{firstname}},
<br>
<br>
As told on the phone, you should have received an access to a repository containing the technical test. Could you please confirm that you've succesfuly received the access please ?
<br>
<br>
The exercise is pretty simple, you need to make a program as great as you can: readable, scalable, maintainable, etc...
<br>
<br>
Do not hesitate to ask questions if you have any.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
